            </ul>

            <h3>Deletion Request Rights</h3>
            <p>You have the right to request that we delete any of your personal information we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request, we will delete (and direct our service providers to delete) your personal information from our records, unless an exception applies.</p>
            
            <p>We may deny your deletion request if retaining the information is necessary for us or our service providers to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete the transaction for which we collected the personal information, provide a good or service that you requested, take actions reasonably anticipated within the context of our ongoing business relationship with you, or otherwise perform our contract with you.</li>
                <li>Detect security incidents, protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity, or prosecute those responsible for such activities.</li>
                <li>Debug products to identify and repair errors that impair existing intended functionality.</li>
                <li>Exercise free speech, ensure the right of another consumer to exercise their free speech rights, or exercise another right provided for by law.</li>
                <li>Comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act (Cal. Penal Code § 1546 seq.).</li>
                <li>Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, if you previously provided informed consent.</li>
                <li>Enable solely internal uses that are reasonably aligned with consumer expectations based on your relationship with us.</li>
                <li>Comply with a legal obligation.</li>
                <li>Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights</h3>
            <p>To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either: (a) sending an e-mail to us at privacy@roundforest.com; or (b) sending a letter to us at Yigal Alon 94, Tel-Aviv 6789156, Israel.</p>
            
            <p>Only you or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your minor child.</p>
            
            <p>You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.</li>
                <li>Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>5. Response Timing and Format</h2>
            <p>We endeavour to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to the registered email associated with the account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.</p>
            
            <p>We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>6. Personal information Sales Opt-Out and Opt-In Rights</h2>

To exercise the right to opt-out, you (or your authorized representative) may submit a request to us by visiting the following our webpage or sending us a message: <a href="https://{{DOMAIN}}/sharing-policy">https://{{DOMAIN}}/sharing-policy</a></p>
